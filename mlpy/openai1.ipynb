    "\n",
    "openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### helper function\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat). \n",

    "## Prompting Principles\n",

    "- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, \"\"\", < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`\n",

    "This will guide the model towards the desired output, \\ \n",
    "and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \\ \n",
    "or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \\ \n",
    "clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \\ \n",
    "In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \\ \n",
