56.72," The Aztec Stadium, a wash with colour, a vibrant atmosphere for this world,"
60.72, quarter-final between Argentina and England.
63.72," Well over 100,000 here to witness it, with Spain or Belgium waiting for the winners in the semi-final."
70.72," Argentina make two changes to the side that beat Uruguay, 1-0 in their second round time."
78.72," Puebla, one of those is enforced with Oscar Garza suspended, meaning Julio Al√°tica-Cher comes in on the left-hand side."
87.72," The other player replaced is Pedro Pascouli, who scored the winner in that match against the Uruguayans."
93.72," And Hector Enrique, the River Plate midfielder, comes in for his first start of the tournament."

108.72," Peter Shilton, England's most camped goalkeeper, makes his 86th appearance for his country."
114.72," The only change to the side that beat Paraguay comes at centre-half, where Terry Fenwick is available after suspension, and he returns in place of Alvin Martin."
123.72," At 29, Peter Reid is the oldest of England's outfield players."
126.72," Steve Hodge continues to provide the solution to England's troublesome left-sided position,"
131.72, whilst Gary Lineker has scored five goals in his last two appearances.
141.72, The referee is the relatively inexperienced Tunisian official Ali Bin Nasser.
154.72," This time next week, here at the Aztec of the World Cup Final, we'll be getting underway."
158.72, One of these two countries will be only one match away from a place in that final.
163.72," For the other, the journey to glory ends today."
167.72," England in the white shirts, defending the end away to our right-hand side in the first half."
173.72, Backline getting an early touch of the ball.
176.72," Mrs Fenwick on his return to the side, now Butcher."
181.72," Hodge has been a revelation on that left-hand side of midfield,"

198.72, I think he'll take it quickly for Reid.
200.72, He'll take it quickly.

214.72, Kenny Sampson prepares to take this throw.

247.72, 48 hours after Argentina had played their match.

266.72, Enrique.
273.72," A model unable to make a tackle, but Gary Stevens puts his foot in for England."
287.72, This is Batista.
291.72, Foul on Maradona.
293.72, Could be back to his feet.
296.72," Just scored the one goal in the tournament so far,"
299.72, which was the equaliser against Italy.
302.72, Tufo's throw.
304.72, Now Batista.
306.72, So much of Argentina's midfield play will build through the bearded 23-year-old.
313.72, Sanchez.
315.72, He's going to be back to his feet.
317.72, He's going to be back to his feet.

353.72, He's got plenty of ground in the early stages.
355.72," There'll be responsibility on him to do that,"
359.72, pushing forward from midfield.
364.72, Expect Reid to cover more ground than Hoddle in the heart of the England midfield alongside him.
386.72," Tufo, who's playing on the right-hand side of the three centre-halves for Argentina."
398.72, Giving that license to push forward and he wins the throw.
408.72," Excellent movement from Maradona, well dealt with by Sansom."
416.72," Maradona again, dispossessed very quickly, this time by Reid."
421.72, Q for England to push the body sport.

435.72, Hoddle.

469.72, Batiste snapping at the heels of Hoddle.
472.72," Definitely touched by Stevens, but England have lost possession again."
479.72, Lada Kuchea gave chase.
494.72, Match being played in searing temperatures.
501.72, Around the mid-80s.

516.72, Reid.
521.72, He's run four for Sansom.
524.72, Well-timed challenge from Jose Luis Brown.
528.72," Of course, Peter Reid."
530.72," Some problems, he's been carrying this ankle injury coming into this game."
536.72, Concern for England will be that Brown's heavy challenge has just exacerbated that same injury.
544.72, It is the right ankle again that he's feeling.
551.72," It's a fair challenge by Brown, England will restart with a throw, taken by Sansom."
558.72, And Fennick with a distinctly speculative effort.
582.72, Batiste.
588.72," Maradona, Reid able to stick his foot in."
601.72, Hoddle.
605.72, Reid.
607.72," Batiste's challenge, now Stevens."
618.72, Clearly a huge amount of respect between these two sides with a very cagey opening to this game.
637.72," He's in the street, unrewarded, conceiving the throw, but it's a chase of lost causes he's been integral to."
648.72, England's campaign so far.
653.72," What a target, able to emerge in possession. Argentina have played their way out very neatly."
659.72, Inevitably everything revolving around Maradona.
663.72," Shown inside by Sansom and cynically brought to the ground by Fennick, who picks up yet another yellow card."
670.72," Portioned inside the opening 10 minutes, a player only just back from suspension."
680.72, Just third yellow card of the tournament.
687.72, Miss timed and reckless lunge by Fennick.
690.72," Shilton asking for a four-man wall, happy that it's in the right place."
698.72," Maradona, you would imagine the favourite to take responsibility here."
709.72, He's Maradona and the Quartet of England players did their job.
713.72," Shilton under pressure from Valdana, happy to concede the corner."
720.72," The first corner of the game, which will be taken on the Argentinian left, 6-4 to attack this."
737.72," With nearly everybody back, it's a disappointing delivery."
741.72, Aladi Kechea.
749.72, Fennick with a much better challenge this time and Maradona still emerges with possession.
755.72, In towards Valdana.
757.72, And Butchett dealt with him admirably.
760.72," Excellent delivery from Maradona, which making Valdano's chance a very difficult one."
776.72," High score, three goals in the tournament already."
780.72," Portioned Valdano, the Real Madrid striker, couple against South Korea and one against Bulgaria."
785.72," They had a fantastic season for Real Madrid, scoring twice in the UEFA Cup final amongst his 24 goals in all competitions this season."
815.72," Butochaga, ahead of Stevens, who've just been drawn out of position."
827.72, An opportunity to deliver.
830.72, And enough bodies back and Stevens can clear.
846.72," Missed the first meeting of these two teams since a friendly back in 1980, which England won 3-1."
854.72," The players involved that day, only Sansom and Maradona play again today."
861.72," Sansom actually gave away a penalty in that game, four foul on Maradona."
864.72, It's the first time that the two nations have met in a competitive meeting since the quarterfinal back in 1966.
876.72," Oh, slip by Pompino. Now, can Beardsley react?"
885.72," Well, it was a good attempt, an instinctive swivel and shot from Peter Beardsley."
889.72," And Pompino coming out, found himself stranded in no man's land, a little stumble had preceded that."
901.72," Peter Beardsley with the shot on the turn, the angle prohibitively tight."
906.72, That's as close as either side has come to scoring.
919.72, Pompino.
937.72, Fenwick.
941.72, Back from Stevens.

967.72, Stevens.
968.72, Stevens.
973.72," It's the finding Bullock Chaga in England, when Argentina had possession more than happy just to drop back and keep their shape behind the ball."
986.72, It's by Bullock Chaga.
992.72, Enrique.
993.72, Valdano.
999.72," Lovely done by Maradona, always a buzz of expectation when every's around the ball."
1008.72, Valdona have a wonderful understanding.
1020.72, Throw from Kachufo.
1024.72, Now England's ball.
1050.72, Sansom.
1054.72, Just too long for Reid.
1061.72, Bullock Chaga.
1070.72, Maradona riding the challenges with ease.
1074.72, Stevens and Stevens doubling up on him.
1076.72, England grateful to hear the whistle of the Tunisian referee for a foul on Beardsley.
1087.72, Argentina can break forward.
1091.72, Now finding decent space around the edge of the England penalty area.
1097.72, The defenders instinctively drawn towards Maradona.
1101.72, Just creating space elsewhere.
1106.72, Butchett giving lices to push forward here for England.
1125.72, It's a goal kick.
1137.72, It's a goal kick.
1154.72, A kick from Matutido.
1166.72, Just the...
1176.72, Maradona.
1178.72," Butchett defended it well, albeit at the expense of a corner."
1183.72, Almost crucial thing there to make sure that no cross was forthcoming.
1196.72, Maradona taking responsibility on so many of these set plays.
1209.72, Worked to the edge of the penalty area.
1210.72," England a little bit slowing coming out, but now the counter-attack will be on."
1222.72, Back from Stevens to Hoddle.
1227.72, Easily dealt at the back by Brown.
1237.72, Maradona.
1240.72, Moving ahead of him from Faldana.
1242.72, Another well-timed challenge by Butchett.
1256.72, Palazzi Gecia.
1287.72, Matista.
1289.72, Maradona.
1295.72, Just wriggling his way through.
1299.72, I think that he was fouled when the whistle does go.
1302.72, It's a freak of giving England's way for a foul on Hoddle.
1316.72, Gecia.
1323.72, Travis Stevens.
1325.72," Turning away from a line to Gecia, but Lineker offside."
1333.72," They just haven't been able to get the front two, but particularly Gary Lineker into the game at all so far."
1342.72," First offside of the game, shown by the Bulgarian official."
1347.72, Lines along the near touch line from Costa Rica.
1357.72, Chufo.
1372.72, Sansom.
1376.72, Beardsley.
1378.72, Most forcing the error out of Chufo.
1382.72, Brown's long clearance.
1384.72, Hoddle.
1385.72, Now Sansom.
1390.72," Maradona again with the opportunity just to bring the ball into his stride, go up through the gears."
1395.72, Only Faldano ahead of him and made it easy for Sansom to intercept.
1401.72, Hoddle guilty of overplaying.
1403.72," At the end, Butcher there to calm things down and guide it back for Shelton."
1406.72, For Shelton.
1424.72, Argentina have been beaten a couple of times.
1427.72," In 1986, lost to France and Norway in friendlies."
1437.72," Very solid group campaign though, taking two wins and a draw from their three matches."
1446.72, South Korea and Bulgaria.
1449.72, Results sandwiched around a draw with Italy.
1460.72," Now another free kick here, which again, Maradona will look to orchestrate."
1467.72, Swept high inside the penalty area.
1471.72, England defending mob handedly.
1474.72, Hammer away by Reid.
1481.72, And from Burichaga.
1483.72, Batista.
1488.72, Giusti.
1497.72, Just a little slip from Trevor Steven meant that he played the ball when he didn't intend to.
1505.72, Just though he's trying to shepherd it out of play for a goal kick.
1508.72, Ended up having to play it.
1519.72, Lardica chair with the throw.
1520.72, Maradona.
1521.72," Another neat turn, but not such a potent cross."
1526.72," And now England's most capped English goalkeeper, he beat Gordon Max's record of 73 appearances for his country last year."
1556.72, Butch another firm challenge that the referee was quick to take exception to.
1567.72," Jerry, the player at fault."
1573.72, And Charlie just denying England the opportunity to take a quick free kick.
1587.72, Pop.
1591.72, Towards Linnica.
1601.72, He'd go out quickly to throw himself at the feet of Beardsley.
1616.72, He's going to get a grip on the game so far.
1638.72," Plenty of misplaced passes, shots at a premium."
1643.72, It's the one nerdy moment for Argentina where Pompino's slip allowed Beardsley.
1649.72," Very difficult chance from a tight angle, but Shilton has been untroubled at the other end."
1660.72, England beaten only once in 15 games coming into this one.
1665.72, They've won 11 of those.
1667.72," Sol defeat, the opening game of the group stage against Portugal."
1675.72, Plenty of soul searching went on after that result and performance.
1686.72, Slowly grown into the tournament as it's gone on.
1690.72," Into the submission start of that defeat, then a draw against Morocco."
1696.72, Stevens with a long throw inside the penalty area.
1707.72, Justi.
1722.72, Butch Aga.
1724.72," Looking up well with Maradona, who's made his way forward."
1729.72, Cross in behind him and Sansom came across and left back to Cleo.
1746.72, Throw from a lot of Kechea.
1749.72, Hammer away by Reid.
1753.72, Henry K. Valdano.
1768.72, He could be defending again by Sansom.
1772.72, Perennial figure of the left-hand side of the England backline these days.
1777.72, He's now started each of the last 31 internationals for his country.
1783.72, Browning very strongly.
1792.72," Stevens linking up well again, the two players who form such a potent access down the right-hand side of Everton's midfield."
1822.72, Four from Steven.
1836.72, They are from Lineker.
1837.72, Still struggling really to show any great degree of attacking intent.
1853.72," Chufo for Argentina, now Brown."
1864.72," Wondering about the British-sounding name, incidentally, of Jose Luis Brown."
1869.72, He's of Scottish descent.
1871.72, Only getting his opportunity because of the injury to Daniel Passarella.
1880.72, He's fouled there by Reid.
1897.72," For this time of the year, to number 16, Zillardi Kechea and Peter Reid in direct confrontation."
1906.72," Henry K. trying to go through the gears, looking for Valdano."
1922.72," Brilliantly done by Maradona, a blind pass back for Valdano."
1926.72," Chilton comes out, that's good goalkeeping."
1936.72," Man came a long way to meet it, Peter Chilton."
1940.72," Off his line very quickly, good anticipation."
1943.72," Reid, in his chance in the heart of the England midfield, because of the absences of both Ray Wilkins and Brian Robson."
1961.72," Wilkins still suspended after his red card against Morocco, as Robson's troublesome shoulder continues to see him sideline."
1991.72, Now familiar side of the wave going around the Azteca Stadium.
2021.72, Making their own entertainment with neither side getting too many views of the opposition penalty area at the moment.
2031.72, He's put a target.
2036.72, Maradona again striding through the gears.
2039.72," Hodge came back, ended up running into Sansom."
2044.72," I think it was Steve Hodge's challenge that the referee took exception to, and he had to do something to try and stop Maradona."
2051.72," That challenge there, Sansom just stood in the way, Maradona already going down."
2063.72, This is another presentable set piece opportunity.
2067.72, The referee just indicating that Maradona won't be able to play the ball until the whistle is blown.
2074.72, Chilton's got five in his wall this time.
2081.72," He's Maradona, shifting the full stretch, mightily relieved that it beat him and the post."
2111.72," Three goals in his nine previous World Cup ties, Diego Maradona."
2118.72," Send off, of course, in the match against Brazil when Argentine were eliminated in 1982."
2141.72," The tag is becoming more of an influence on the game now, but he's ran into an England brick wall."
2158.72," Hoddle, Beardsley, sold Hoddle that little bit short."
2163.72," Another opportunity for Argentina to bring it forward here with Justi, and he's then been fouled by Hodge."
2171.72, Tempers beginning to get a little bit frayed.
2192.72, Again it's Maradona and Burichaga standing over it.
2196.72, Maradona wins the corner off the wall.
2201.72," As always, the Argentinian support, vociferous."
2215.72, Just asking a couple of the photographers to move so that he can get the right line of attack for this corner.
2237.72," They have to pull the flag back in, both the pole and the flag."
2255.72, Shouldn't have taken it out in the first place.
2264.72," Maradona's corner, well claimed by Shilton."
2286.72," Father's time on, Trevor Steven."
2307.72, Long delivery from Stevens.
2310.72, The threat immediately repelled by Argentina and Maradona is the beneficiary just ghosting past Hoddle in the midfield.
2317.72, Look at the little man go here.
2320.72, Stevens able to effect the block and then a slice clearance.
2324.72, Goes out of play for a corner despite Shilton's best efforts.
2328.72, Steve Hodge was back.
2337.72," That was where England certainly missed either Wilkins or Robson, the way that Maradona just motored through the heart of the midfield away from Glenn Hoddle."
2346.72," Argentina have a fourth corner here, which will be taken by Jorge Butchaga."
2355.72, There's his cup football in France with not.
2358.72, Artica Chale with the throw in the final eight minutes of the first half.
2380.72, 0-0.
2395.72, Maradona winning the race to keep it in and Shilton again under pressure.
2400.72, Shows a safe pair of hands.
2403.72," Just conducted an immediate inquest there with Gary Stevens, not happy about the fact that the cross was allowed to come in in the first place."
2419.72, Ford comes from Reid to Sanson.
2428.72, Just with a little stumble there.
2432.72, No harm done. Both sides have been finding the conditions underfoot a little bit difficult.
2446.72, Beardsley.
2449.72, Still unable to get Lineker into the game.
2452.72, Chufo hammers it upfield.
2474.72, Maradona never willing to chase.
2477.72," Back from Sanson, who has been voted into the PFA team of the year in England for the seventh successive season."
2502.72, It's the best left back in the country.
2516.72," Still pretty devoid really of attacking intent, happy just to try and contain Argentina without the majority of possession."
2532.72, Alot of the chair.
2540.72, Well to emerge with possession under Gerese.
2544.72, Happy to leave the ball to Maradona.
2550.72, I think they'll be more than happy to allow Centre Hartz to shoot from 30 yards.
2557.72, Chufo it was that blazed high and wide of Shilton's goal.
2569.72, Train had just been caught on here because of the knock that Maradona has picked up to the face.
2584.72, Bobby Robson fullsome of his praise for Maradona.
2587.72," Before the game saying that without him, Argentina would have no chance of winning the World Cup."
2594.72, He just picked up the injury there as he was running towards the edge of the penalty area.
2601.72, Just a little collision with both players having eyes on the ball.
2611.72, What a goal scoring record he's got.
2614.72, Nearly 150 goals in Argentina before he turned 22.
2620.72, First player to break the world transfer record twice.
2624.72, That is time at Barcelona whilst full of goals wasn't necessarily regarded as a success.
2634.72, Now revered in Naples.
2673.72, Time's throw.
2677.72, Handball by Reid.
2682.72, I think he was held by a slightly erratic bounce of the ball.
2693.72, Initially taken by Enrique.
2695.72, Straight into the referee.
2698.72, The avoidance of daddy asked for it to be retaken.
2700.72, White by Fenwick.
2715.72, But a Shaga.
2720.72, Maradona.
2724.72, Batista.
2728.72, But a Shaga.
2730.72, To improvise.
2732.72, Maradona in a wider position picking up possession.
2737.72, Hobble and Beinzli between them.
2740.72, Able to repel the threat and get England going on the counter attack.
2745.72, It's a rare touch for Linneke.
2748.72, Changing a throw for Argentina taking quickly by the journey.
2761.72, It's just it.
2771.72, White by Brown.
2775.72, Badana.
2777.72, Maradona.
2781.72, 70 grand looking for a free kick.
2784.72, It was Peter Reid with the challenge.
2791.72, Sansom invited forward again for England.
2794.72, Now Reid.
2809.72, Into the last minute of the first half.
2813.72, Both sides but particularly England.
2815.72, Happy to play the long game.
2817.72, Just waiting for something to happen.
2821.72, Concerned about.
2823.72, Shattling Maradona and keeping things tight defensively than having a real go themselves.
2843.72, Two quarterfinals that we've already seen of.
2848.72, Both gone.
2850.72, The whole distance all the way through the penalties.
2862.72, Rare England set piece opportunity here.
2864.72, Sansom leaving it for Hoddle who's chipped it cleverly forward into space but the offside flag is up.
2873.72, The first half comes to an end.
2875.72, 45 minutes.
2876.72, It was bereft largely of goal scoring opportunity.
2890.72, One skirmish inside the Argentinian penalty area after a stumble and slip from Pompidio.
2893.72, But Beinzli was unable to capitalize on that.
2896.72, Shilton largely untroubled at the other end.
2899.72, And at half time it's 0-0.
2953.72, It's 0-0.
2954.72, It's 0-0.
2983.72, It's 0-0.
3013.72, It's 0-0.
3043.72, It's 0-0.
3073.72, It's 0-0.
3104.72, It's 0-0.
3121.72, Ali Bin Nasser checks his watch.
3123.72, We're back underway for the second half.
3126.72, Argentina nil.
3127.72, England nil.
3128.72, And it'll be interesting to see if there's a change in tact from England.
3136.72, Whether they will be happy just to continue to put bodies behind the ball.
3142.72, Prevent Argentina finding a way through.
3146.72, Whether they will decide at some stage that they need to show a little bit more attacking endeavour.
3153.72, No changes made at half time.
3156.72, Batista's ball forward.
3158.72, And Valdana wins the first free kick of the second half.
3180.72, Well it's a long way out.
3182.72, Huge distance out.
3185.72, Ball clipped in.
3190.72, There's a goal kick that's been given.
3203.72, Chilton just asking for clarification.
3211.72, Free kick for the offside in fact.
3213.72, Taking short to butcher.
3219.72, England have kept three clean sheets in a row.
3221.72, The only goal that they've conceded so far in the tournament coming to Portugal's Carlos Manuel.
3227.72, In fact that's the only goal that they've conceded in six and a half games now.
3231.72, If you include the pre-tournament friendlies.
3234.72, So defensive resolution is something that has been high on the agenda for a while.
3244.72, Sansom's ball forward.
3251.72, Manadona put a chaga.
3255.72, The chaga continue his run.
3258.72, Stevens has found himself in a difficult position for a moment but his teammates there to bail him out.
3274.72, Who've raised against Batista.
3276.72, Free kick taken quickly but a chaga.
3278.72, Losing out to butcher.
3281.72, And the ball back to Chilton.
3303.72, That was better from England.
3314.72, Sansom will come across to take the throw.
3316.72, One by Hodge.
3324.72, Here is Hodge.
3325.72, And Lenneke making a darting run in towards the near post.
3334.72, The ball delivered deeper than that.
3338.72, Stevens winning the second ball here for England.
3343.72, Brown with the header away.
3347.72, Maradona going up for it.
3348.72, The loose ball breaking for Valdana.
3351.72, And Argentina trying to get bodies forward quickly here to expose England when they haven't got their shape behind the ball.
3358.72, But you're doing well to hold up Valdano.
3361.72, But a chaga.
3373.72, Aladdin to chair.
3378.72, Maradona.
3380.72, And again with a tight rigid formation behind the ball as Aladdin to chair place it in.
3390.72, Valdano's touch just gives bids to the opportunity to win it back for England.
3403.72, This hodl.
3411.72, But yeah.
3428.72, Chufo.
3431.72, Batista.
3433.72, Manrique.
3434.72, Aladdin to chair.
3443.72, Maradona again easily moving away from hodl in the heart of the midfield.
3447.72, It's hooked back over the top and Maradona has scored.
3451.72, First blood to Argentina.
3454.72, England far from happy.
3456.72, Think they've seen an infringement.
3458.72, Still the protest continued.
3460.72, Terry Fenwick absolutely adamant.
3462.72, I think that he saw a handball.
3467.72, The goal allowed to stand.
3469.72, His hodge hooking it back towards his own goalkeeper and that is why England are so furious.
3475.72, Maradona has punched it in with his left hand.
3480.72, Chilton slightly slow coming off his line maybe.
3488.72, Maradona has deceived the officials.
3493.72, Argentina strike first and you can understand why England are so furious that the goal has been allowed to stand.
3511.72, Argentina won.
3513.72, England nil.
3515.72, Goal swathed in controversy.
3518.72, Looks like the ball might have hit a hand in there.
3520.72, The referee unmoved this time.
3523.72, Here's Stephens.
3525.72, Back for hodl.
3527.72, Now England's defence has been breached.
3530.72, They are immediately on the front foot.
3532.72, Peter Chilton still saving.
3538.72, Argentinian supporters delighted.
3547.72, The side have been dominant and they have the breakthrough albeit in extremely controversial circumstances.
3562.72, So what will England's reply be?
3585.72, Maradona.
3587.72, Valdana.
3592.72, Hoddl was fouled as he put it back to his goalkeeper.
3606.72, The referee can only give what he sees but you would imagine that the Bulgarian linesmen on the far touch line would have had a good view of it.
3617.72, Goal allowed to stand.
3619.72, It's given away here by Stephens.
3624.72, Argentina on the front foot again.
3628.72, What a target.
3630.72, Maradona.
3631.72, Maradona.
3643.72, Now England have to try and do what both Bulgaria and Uruguay have failed to do in the last two games and that's breached this Argentinian back line.
3652.72, Maradona.
3656.72, Nice goal they've conceded coming against Italy in the second game of the tournament.
3662.72, Hoddl given away cheaply again.
3669.72, Maradona brilliantly just gets away from Reid and now motors up through the gears and he's beaten Butcher and he's beaten Fedick.
3677.72, It's Diego Maradona and it is quite magnificent.
3683.72, If there was an element of doubt about the first goal there's no controversy about that moment of genius from Diego Maradona.
3693.72, Two goals in four minutes and Argentina lead England 2-0.
3701.72, The goal of breathtaking quality.
3704.72, Walsing through the England midfield drawing the defence rounding the goalkeeper.
3715.72, One of the most memorable goals of the tournament.
3720.72, In fact arguably two of the most memorable goals of the tournament but for completely different reasons.
3726.72, Carlos Bilard those men in comfortable control now 2-0 up barely 10 minutes into the second half.
3736.72, England have a mountain to climb.
3756.72, Beardsley.
3762.72, Piedo able to get in the way of the optimistic effort.
3770.72, I think they might say that they were stung by the sense of injustice about the first goal.
3776.72, But there are a few that relinquish defensive responsibilities as Maradona strode purposefully through their midfield.
3785.72, I think this might be England's first corner of the game.
3795.72, Trevor Steven will take it.
3801.72, Hoddle.
3804.72, Just wanted too much time on the ball he really hasn't been able to deliver of his best so far today Glenn Hoddle.
3816.72, Well it would be interesting to see exactly what.
3818.72, Well it would be interesting to see exactly what the Tunisian referee could see.
3848.72, From his vantage point when the ball came in for Maradona's first goal.
3863.72, Hodge beginning to struggle on that left hand side of the England midfield.
3867.72, Whether it's going through his head the part that he had to play in the first goal with his miscued shank back pass towards Peter Shilton.
3879.72, Hodge who was in danger of going home and not making the squad before the friendly against Canada but has certainly contributed well.
3887.72, Excellent against Poland having been on the bench for the first two games but just struggling at the moment out there.
3896.72, They do have some attacking intent on the bench.
3902.72, The likes of Woddle and Barnes two players who could come on in wide positions if necessary.
3910.72, Must be going through Bobby Robson's mind already that something has to change.
3928.72, England with a greater emphasis on attack now.
3930.72, Sampson throws it long inside the penalty area. Peter came out.
3937.72, Hodge nipping in at the near post couldn't quite get the touch run it was blocked immediately behind him for a corner.
3944.72, Good near post flick.
3960.72, It's taken by complete up.
3990.72, That's a pull challenge from Batista and he receives the yellow card.
4005.72, First Argentinian player booked.
4008.72, This is Batista who only made his debut back in November against Mexico.
4022.72, Giving away a free kick which is potentially promising position here for England if Hoddle can sweep it forward with his normal accuracy.
4032.72, Plenty of pace on it.
4034.72, Needed a defensive touch which has given England a corner.
4038.72, He's in Louise Brown. Player not taking any chances.
4042.72, In from Hoddle towards the near post didn't have the elevation that was needed.
4065.72, Second ball is a better one but Pompido denies Beardsley.
4073.72, First delivery.
4076.72, Keeping with many of Hoddle so far today was a slight miss here but Peter Beardsley attacked that second one well.
4085.72, Only got a couple of goals for England so far.
4102.72, Butch's ball forward giving away to Butch Haggart.
4116.72, So Val d'Arno ahead of him but couldn't find him. England closing ranks.
4121.72, It was noticeable in the game against Paraguay. England gave plenty of space to the front pair Romerito and Caballas.
4132.72, Hasn't been the case today so much to Maradona and Val d'Arno.
4140.72, Judging by some of the comments from the Argentinians in the press conference they believed it was something that might be exploited today.
4151.72, Stevens climbing high to keep it in might wish that he hadn't bothered as he just presented it to Aladi Kechea.
4159.72, Butch Haggart. Aladi Kechea ending up on the deck at the hands of Steven.
4181.72, Well this was the stage that foiled Argentina four years ago when as world champions they lost to both Italy and Brazil.
4210.72, Brazil in the second group stage of the 1982 World Cup. They're in a comfortable position here leading by two goals to nil.
4222.72, The winners let me remind you will take on either Spain or Belgium in the semi-final.
4240.72, Relentless following from the Argentinian support.
4254.72, England's first change Peter Reed who's been struggling with the ankle problem is the man who's going to be replaced by Chris Waddle.
4272.72, So an attacking change made by Bobby Robson.
4275.72, Waddle who scored 14 goals in his successful first season for Tottenham.
4282.72," Here's Beardsley, Waddle's former Newcastle team mate hooking it in. Perpido did well."
4299.72," Beardsley twisting and gyrating well, it's a decent delivery. Excellent goal given by Neri Perpedo."
4316.72," The veteran of the squad from four years ago, although he was third choice and didn't play in Spain."
4334.72, Half an hour away from a World Cup semi-final.
4338.72," Thanks to that man, Maradona whose two goals have been the difference between the two teams."
4347.72, Just got a flailing arm around the side of the head there from Fenwick. It's not the first clash between the pair of them.
4372.72, There was one at the end of the first half to the face of Maradona.
4379.72, So Maradona off the field receiving trim and it's Boruchaga who will take the set piece responsibility.
4398.72, Stradec Shilton.
4403.72, It's significant that only Valdana was up in support for Boruchaga as he took that free kick.
4411.72, Everybody else back for Argentina. What they have they hold.
4415.72, Holden with a crossfield pass. First opportunity now for Waddell.
4446.72, It's Fenwick.
4455.72, Sansom.
4464.72, Batista with a header away picked up by Hoddle.
4469.72, Waddell.
4475.72, Now Stevens.
4479.72, Went for goal himself.
4483.72, And then England win a free kick.
4488.72, Maradona allowed back on the field of play Argentina restored to the full complement of 11 with the return of their talismanic captain.
4499.72, England were unable to make the most of the numerical advantage.
4505.72, Six in Pompidos wall.
4516.72, Hoddle. Good strike.
4526.72, Put it past the wall which was just about in the right place.
4535.72," Hoddle sweeping the corner in, then finding an Argentinian player."
4544.72, Both fashion it by Waddell who's an excellent delivery into a potentially dangerous area but nobody there to attack it for England.
4551.72, It was a clever cross with the outside of his left foot.
4566.72, Butcher.
4574.72, Stevens.
4578.72, By a lot to get chair.
4596.72, Batista.
4604.72, Batista.
4608.72, Batista with Cucifo.
4610.72, It will be an Argentinian throw but only after Pompido has received a little bit of attention.
4631.72, It was a bang to the arm sustained and saving that hoddle free kick perhaps.
4645.72, Does allow Argentina just to break up the play.
4650.72, Get some fluid on board.
4654.72, Make any subtle alterations to the game plan that are necessary for the time that remains.
4661.72, No.
4691.72, Stevens.
4692.72, Stevens.
4693.72, Stevens.
4715.72, Play now concentrated by a large.
4717.72, Inside the Argentinian half but no stage is the lead look fragile.
4724.72, They are going to make a change as you can see.
4726.72, Carlos Tapia.
4728.72, Player that will be coming on in a moment.
4744.72, Another England corner to be taken by hoddle.
4748.72, That's a goal kick.
4751.72, Fanny coming to meet it.
4777.72, Fanny.
4798.72, Long by Shelton.
4800.72, Lenica.
4802.72, Easily beaten in the air by Ruggieri.
4804.72, Sansom.
4810.72, Woddle.
4826.72, Sansom.
4828.72, Speculatively punt inside the penalty area coming from Glenn Hoddle.
4836.72, Headed back over the top dealt with by Brown.
4847.72, England not afraid to use the emergency exit behind them.
4850.72, Peter Shelton.
4852.72," As you can see at the bottom of your picture there, a second England change is imminent with John Barnes."
4860.72, Set to come on for what will be his World Cup debut.
4871.72, He's on for Trevor Stevens.
4875.72, There's been a lot of clamour for Barnes to.
4877.72, Have more of a part within this England team in this World Cup campaign.
4887.72, Long for his 28th cap.
4892.72, He's seldom been able to replicate his formidable Watford form in an England shirt.
4897.72, He has an opportunity now with 15 minutes or so to go.
4903.72, May well be the only 15 minutes he plays in this World Cup campaign unless he can provide some real inspiration.
4927.72, Half an hour into the second half.
4930.72, Argentina with a stranglehold on the game.
4934.72, No stage as their lead looked fragile.
4943.72," For the free kick he's taken, they're going to make a change."
4946.72, It's Butchaga who's going to come off.
4950.72, Carlos Tapia will come on to replace him.
4953.72, A man who crossed the river Boca divide in Argentina last year.
4960.72, Move from one side of Buenos Aires to the other.
4964.72, The 23-year-old will come on for the final quarter of an hour.
4975.72," Two Boca players on the pitch now, along with Julio Alateca Chaya."
4985.72, Costa Rican linesman indicates an England throw.
4990.72, Scoreboard indicates the size of their impending task.
4994.72, They have a free kick here as
4999.72, Ruggieri
5004.72, found Waddle.
5005.72, Argentina seemingly not knowing how to defend this free kick
5018.72, bent in by Hoddle towards the back post and the header from Butcher straight into the hands of Pompido.
5031.72, Just had to react quickly.
5032.72, And in doing so couldn't generate the power or get the direction right to beat the Argentinian goalkeeper.
5063.72," It's a little coming together off the ball there involving Butcher, the play goes on."
5067.72, Sanson plays it forward and was fouled.
5070.72, Once the ball had gone by Ecto Enrique.
5077.72, Maradona talking to the referee about the earlier
5081.72, challenge in that same move as England brought it out from the back.
5092.72," Hoddle with the free kick, plenty offside."
5122.72, Let's go.
5152.72, Four from Butcher.
5166.72, Barnes the player that England need to try and get into the game here.
5170.72, They have another free kick.
5185.72, The game becoming increasingly fragmented.
5192.72, That won't phase England too much if they can build up a catalogue of set-piece opportunities
5199.72, around the edge of the penalty area.
5217.72, The reverse ball for Barnes was the intention.
5219.72, Didn't come off from Hoddle.
5222.72, Not too much of what England have tried in an attacking context has come off.
5236.72, Sanson with another long throw.
5242.72, Stevens.
5244.72, Barnes looking it on towards Lineker.
5249.72, Argentina repelling the thread again.
5252.72, Back from Hodge.
5254.72," Barnes getting towards the byline, he's done well."
5257.72, It's Lineker and England are back in the game.
5261.72, The rare attempt on target halves the deficit and sets up a frantic last ten minutes.
5279.72, First chance that England have had to get the ball to the feet of Barnes.
5284.72," Excellent run, pinpoint delivery, the kind of service on which Lineker thrives."
5290.72, His sixth goal of the tournament.
5301.72, Now Maradona as Argentina look to restore their two goal cushion straight away.
5307.72, Tapia hits the post.
5311.72, Almost a goal at either end in the space of 30 seconds or so.
5319.72," Now Waddle, England with their tails up."
5334.72," Ball for just too long for Pompido, the offside flag is up."
5338.72," Well, Lineker gave chase from Pompido."
5351.72," He knew that he could come and collect it relatively comfortably, but he's seen the flag come up, decided to kick the ball away."
5359.72, Just waste a few more valuable seconds.
5368.72, Butch out.
5399.72," Ricardo Giusti, former Copa Libertadores winner with the throw."
5424.72," With just a little faint glimmer of hope again, time very much against them."
5446.72, Throw from Giusti.
5453.72," England turning over possession, neatly in the midfield, but again nothing comes of it."
5477.72, Stevens.
5484.72, Poddle.
5493.72, Valdano almost taking liberties.
5498.72, Giusti.
5500.72," Butch with a late challenge on him, Argentina able to bring the ball forward with real attacking intent and Valbano goes to ground."
5513.72," England defense for the first time, brutally exposed."
5544.72," Stretcher there for Valdano, who's being told that any treatment he receives has to be off the field of play."
5554.72, Message that's prelude to a remarkable recovery.
5558.72," Argentina goal now makes the game safe, cements their place in the semi-finals."
5579.72," Maradona on a hat-trick, can't hit the target."
5588.72," Can England create one more chance, can they get the ball to waddle or barns?"
5604.72, Utilize the width.
5610.72," Straight ball over the top, is this the moment? No."
5614.72," Excellent, defending by Brown to cover the run of Sansom."
5631.72," Sansom again, launching a long one inside the penalty area."
5636.72, Some tired legs out there now on the England team.
5641.72, Waddle.
5644.72, Blocked off by Tapia.
5647.72, Precursor to an Argentina counter-attack.
5650.72, Wonderful challenge by the retreating Hodge to dispossess Maradona.
5654.72, And now barns.
5657.72," He's got Lineker and Beardsley in the middle, if he can get it across."
5661.72," And he can get it across, and it was so close."
5673.72, It's Lineker and not the ball that ends up over the line.
5678.72," Tantalizing delivery, really good defensive header."
5683.72," Getting it out of the path of Lineker, who's hurt in the process."
5688.72, I wonder why England didn't bring barns on sooner than they did.
5694.72," He's caused problems whenever he's had it, and he's been able to run particularly at Enrique."
5718.72, Off Maradona.
5720.72, Had a play for an England throw.
5722.72, Argentina nearly there.
5724.72," Sansom again, looking for barns."
5727.72, And Brown can shepherd it over the line.
5729.72, Had a play for an Argentina goal kick.
5739.72," Well, this will be revenge for Argentina for the..."
5743.72," Defeated the quarterfinals in 1966 when Jeff Hurst's late goal gave England the win,"
5748.72," when Ratin sent off famously for Argentina, who refused to leave the field."
5763.72, Here's barns.
5766.72, Three Argentinian players converging on him.
5773.72," Maradona, boot-raced high by Butcher."
5778.72, Indirect free kick to Argentina.
5780.72," Unsurprisingly, they work it all the way back for Compido."
5810.72, The 90 minutes are up.
5825.72, It's all now time being added at the discretion of the referee.
5835.72, Stevens.
5837.72," England desperate to get it forward, quickly."
5842.72, Unable to get decent possession of the ball at the moment.
5846.72, Maradona.
5851.72," Enrique, having to take the ball down at the corner flag."
5855.72, Can't do any harm to Argentinian prospects there.
5866.72, Shilton driving it forward as quickly as he can.
5872.72," It was a good, effective long kick as well."
5877.72, Waddle with the throw for England.
5881.72," Stevens with the ball forward, the whistle is gone."
5884.72, Argentina are through.
5888.72," Two Diego Maradona goals, enough to beat England."
5893.72," 20 years on after their elimination in the 1966 quarterfinals,"
5898.72, they've beaten England in the 86 quarterfinals.
5901.72," Maradona with two goals, both of which will be talked about for a long, long time."
5907.72," The second, a moment of sheer, sublime artistry."
5912.72," The first, less so."
5916.72, But Maradona will take the plaudits.
5918.72," Argentina in the semifinals, they've beaten England 2-1."
5948.72," For more information, visit www.fema.gov"
